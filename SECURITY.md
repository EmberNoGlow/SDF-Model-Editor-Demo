| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.x.x | ✔ | Latest version. Unstable, under active development |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **SDF Editor**, please follow the process below. **Do not** open a public issue or post details on public forums (like GitHub Issues, mailing lists, or social media) before we have had a chance to address the issue.

### 1. How to Report

Please report all security vulnerabilities privately by **emailing** the security team at:

- *Email* -> eng-SDF@protonmail.com
- *Blue Sky PM* -> [EmberNoGlow.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/embernoglow.bsky.social)

### 2. What to Include in Your Report

To help us triage and resolve the issue quickly, please include as much detail as possible:

*   **A clear description** of the vulnerability.
*   **Product version(s)** (e.g., "v0.1.0").
*   **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability (including environment details like OS, language version, etc.).
*   **A suggested fix or mitigation**, if you have one.
*   **Your contact information** (optional).

### 3. Our Commitment and Timeline

Once we receive your report, we commit to the following timeline for acknowledgment and resolution:

| Step | Expected Timeframe |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Acknowledgment** | Within **5-7 days** |
| **Triage & Initial Response** | Within **7-10 days** |
| **Resolution & Patch Release** | We aim to have a patch ready within **28 days** of confirmation. |

If the timeline for a fix is expected to exceed **28 days**, we will communicate the delay and the reasons to you privately.

### 4. Disclosure Policy

We follow a responsible disclosure timeline:

1.  We will work with you privately to develop and release a patch.
2.  Once the patch is released, we will work with you to **coordinate a public disclosure** of the vulnerability details.
3.  We typically wait **7 days** after the patch is publicly available before releasing technical details, unless a longer period is mutually agreed upon.
4.  We will publicly credit you for your responsible report, provided you wish to be credited.

### 5. Vulnerability Acceptance/Decline

*   **Accepted Vulnerabilities:** If the vulnerability is confirmed and falls within the scope of **SDF Editor**, we will prioritize a fix and communicate status updates as per the timeline above.
*   **Declined Vulnerabilities:** If a report is declined (e.g., it's an issue in a third-party dependency, a known limitation, or outside the security scope of the project), we will explain why the report is being closed.
